      <h2>Defining the Topic</h2>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p>In today’s world, digital security plays an important role 
            in protecting individuals from online threats. 
            One of most serious threats within the area of digital 
            security identity theft, which involves illegally obtaining 
            an individual’s personal details, such as credit card numbers 
            or social security details with the intention of impersonating 
            them for financial or personal gain. (Baecker, 2019). 
            Due to the evolution of technology, biometric data has become more 
            widespread and offers features that increases protection and security.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Dantcheva (2015) defined biometrics as “the science of recognizing 
            individuals  based on their physical, behavioral, and physiological  
            attributes such as fingers, face, iris, gait and voice” (p.1). 
            Unlike passwords and patterns biometric traits cannot be changed, 
            therefore, securing this data is essential in reducing the risk of identity theft. </p>

<h2>Background</h2>
    <div class="paragraph">        
        <p>
            Today, biometric data is rapidly emerging as one of the most effective tools in fighting against identity theft.
            Unlike traditional passwords or PINs, which can be forgotten, stolen, or hacked, biometric data such as fingerprints,
            facial recognition, and iris scans are unique to each individual, making them harder to replicate or misuse.

            This website, created by Carleen, James & Natu, explores how biometric technologies are reshaping digital security.
            As we move further into a data-driven world, understanding biometrics is essential to building secure, accessible systems
            that protect our personal identity and help mitigate identity theft.
