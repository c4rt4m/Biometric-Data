            Today, biometric data is rapidly emerging as one of the most effective tools in fighting against identity theft.
            Unlike traditional passwords or PINs, which can be forgotten, stolen, or hacked, biometric data such as fingerprints,
            facial recognition, and iris scans are unique to each individual, making them harder to replicate or misuse.

            This website, created by Carleen, James & Natu, explores how biometric technologies are reshaping digital security.
            As we move further into a data-driven world, understanding biometrics is essential to building secure, accessible systems
            that protect our personal identity and help mitigate identity theft.
