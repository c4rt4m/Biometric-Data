<h1>Technology Opportunities</h1>
        <div class="h3">
          <div class="paragraph">
            <p>An opportunity is defined as: “A time or set of circumstances that makes it possible to do something”. 
              Biometric data presents society with various opportunities, many of which are beneficial.  </p>
            <p></p>
            <p>One of biometric data’s main opportunities seems to be its use for security purposes. 
              This opportunity is a good fit as biometric is unique and cannot be replicated. Examples of biometric data include iris’, fingerprints and faces - traits that are different for each human. 
              Many different sectors of the security industry currently utilise biometric data. Devices such phones and laptops currently use “face id” and “touch id” as forms of identification for each user. 
              While biometric data works well on its own, according to Arora, S., & Bhatia, M. P. . (2022)1 biometric data is best used in tandem with other security methods such as passwords and pins. 
              This is to help prevent “spoofing” - a method where false biometric data is used to gain unauthorised access. 
              When using biometric data along with other security options, the difficulty of breaching the system is increased, leading to a much better security system. </p>
            <p></p>
            <p>An opportunity within the security sector also arises when AI comes into consideration. 
              While AI could pose a potential threat to the usage of biometric data, it could also be useful in preventing spoofing through utilisation of deep learning algorithms. 
              Arora, S., & Bhatia, M. P. . (2022) state that “Deep learning approaches have an edge over traditional state-of-the-art methods because they can efficiently learn features from data. 
              They are suitable for traits like face and voice which require feature learning in a hierarchical manner.” This means that AI could be used to learn from biometric data to prevent spoofing and ensure the security system is solid. </p>
            <p></p>
            <p>There are many places that have already given biometric data opportunities in surveillance and law enforcement sectors. The article by Chiu Mei Lim, A., Hui Xian Ng, L., & Taeihagh, A. (2024)2 gives several examples. 
              Facial recognition is often used for surveillance purposes, for example: the Singaporean government planned to implement facial recognition technology on more than 100 thousand lampposts. 
              This could aid law enforcement with tracking down criminals or capturing crimes happening. Another instance of law enforcement benefiting from biometric data is when the American company “Clearview” scraped social media for images, creating a database of 30 billion images then subsequently developing a facial recognition software with the accumulated biometric data. 
              This software was then sold to law enforcement agencies. Despite ethical issues, this presented police with a far advanced method of locating/identifying suspects, aiding in the fight against crime. </p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Biometric data ultimately has many useful opportunities. This is proven by how it is already commonplace in many different systems in different parts of the world. 
              From here, we will only see more and more opportunities for biometric data as AI and other new tech advancements are made, opening us up to plenty more pathways.</p>
