		<td> <em>In today’s world, digital security plays an important role in protecting individuals 
			from online threats. One of most serious threats within the area of digital security identity theft, 
			which involves illegally obtaining an individual’s personal details, such as credit card numbers or 
			social security details with the intention of impersonating them for financial or personal gain (Baecker, 2019). 
			Due to the evolution of technology, biometric data has become more widespread and offers features that 
			increases protection and security.
			
			Dantcheva (2015) defined biometrics as “the science of recognizing individuals based on their physical, 
			behavioral, and physiological attributes such as fingers, face, iris, gait and voice” (p.1). Unlike 
			passwords and patterns biometric traits cannot be changed, therefore, securing this data is essential 
			in reducing the risk of identity theft.</em></td>
