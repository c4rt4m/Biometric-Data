<h1>Technology Choices</h1>
        <div class="h3">

            <p>Biometric data as a technology comes with various choices for when it is implemented into society. 
              It seems these choices could see the tech follow an ethical or unethical pathway, depending on which ones are made.  </p>
            <p></p>
            <p>One choice for biometric data when it is implemented into society will surely be how data privacy is handled. As biometric data is unique, it is therefore tied to each individual person. 
              This brings the question of whether buying and selling biometric data could be a violation of human rights. A way that could potentially quell this ethical dilemma is to allow individuals to decide whether their biometric data is shared or not. 
              This could work similarly to Apple’s approach, where individuals can opt in/out of sharing their data and identifiers with certain apps. 
              Another ideal choice for this matter is to allow the storage and facilitation of biometric data with the introduction of strict rules that must be followed to ensure things are kept ethically, and no data is sold/traded without permission. 
              Lúcia Raposo, V. (2023) states: “The GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) places strict obligations on both data controllers and data processors. As non-compliance can lead to legal sanctions, processors and controllers must take the GDPR’s requirements seriously.” 
              This shows an example of how already action is being taken to ensure there are consequences in place because of gross misuse of biometric data. </p>
            <p></p>
            <p>A second choice is how biometric data can be collected. There are various ways biometric data can be collected, whether it be through surveillance cameras with facial recognition technology, fingerprint scanners on phones, or voice scanners. 
              The way data is collected has a big ethical impact. For example, while police collecting face scans from surveillance cameras may be useful for catching criminals, it could also be seen as a violation of privacy. 
              Malik G (2024) states that: “Given that biometric authentication systems have considerable ethical issues, particularly concerning giving the government access, a balance between the need for personal security and the threats posed by government surveillance must be worked out post haste.” 
              This suggests that there needs to be a balance between what data can be collected and what data can’t. Perhaps a way to aid this is to ensure law enforcement/the government can only access a person’s biometric data if they have a warrant or evidence of a crime, preventing unreasonable privacy breaches. </p>
            <p></p>
            <p>These are some choices that must be considered when biometric data is implemented into society, as the way biometric data is implemented could bring about ethical dilemmas that infringe on the privacy and security of human beings, a violation of human rights. </p>
