      <h2>What is Biometric Data?</h2>
      <p>
        Biometric authentication uses unique physical and behavioral characteristics to verify identity.
        It offers greater security than traditional methods such as passwords or PINs.

      <h3>Types of Biometric Data</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Physiological:</strong> Fingerprints, facial recognition, iris scans, voice patterns.</li>
        <li><strong>Behavioral:</strong> Typing patterns, gait analysis, mouse movements.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section-box">
      <h3>Benefits of Biometrics</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Each biometric trait is unique, reducing the risk of identity fraud.</li>
        <li>Biometric data cannot be easily transferred or stolen like passwords.</li>
        <li>Offers a faster and more user-friendly authentication process.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section-box">
      <h3>Risks & Limitations</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Biometric breaches are permanent — you can’t change your fingerprint.</li>
        <li>Storing biometric data raises serious privacy concerns.</li>
        <li>Advanced spoofing techniques may still bypass biometric systems.</li>

        <div class="paragraph">
          <p>In today’s world, digital security plays an important role 
            in protecting individuals from online threats. 
            One of most serious threats within the area of digital 
            security identity theft, which involves illegally obtaining 
            an individual’s personal details, such as credit card numbers 
            or social security details with the intention of impersonating 
            them for financial or personal gain. (Baecker, 2019). 
            Due to the evolution of technology, biometric data has become more 
            widespread and offers features that increases protection and security.</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>Dantcheva (2015) defined biometrics as “the science of recognizing 
            individuals  based on their physical, behavioral, and physiological  
            attributes such as fingers, face, iris, gait and voice” (p.1). 
            Unlike passwords and patterns biometric traits cannot be changed, 
            therefore, securing this data is essential in reducing the risk of identity theft. </p>
