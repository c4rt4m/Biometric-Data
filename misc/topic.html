 <h1>Biometric Data: The Key to Identity Theft Prevention</h1>
        <div class="h3">
            <h2>Defining the Topic</h2>
            <div class="paragraph">
                <p>In today’s world, digital security plays an important role in protecting 
                  individuals from online threats. 
                  One of most serious threats within the area of digital security identity theft, 
                  which involves illegally obtaining an individual’s personal details, 
                  such as credit card numbers or social security details with the intention of 
                  impersonating them for financial or personal gain. (Baecker, 2019). 
                  Due to the evolution of technology, biometric data has become more widespread and offers cutting-edge 
                  features that increases protection and security.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>Dantcheva (2015) defined biometrics as “the science of recognizing individuals 
                  based on their physical, behavioral, and physiological  attributes such as fingers, 
                  face, iris, gait and voice” (p.1). Unlike passwords and patterns biometric traits cannot be 
                  changed, therefore, securing this data is essential in reducing the risk of identity theft.</p>
                <p></p>
            </div>
              
            <h2>Overview of Biometrics</h2>
            <div class="paragraph">
                <p>Biometric authentication is a method of verifying a person’s 
                  identity by using their physical or behavioral traits. 
                  These traits are unique to an individual and include forms of 
                  identification such as fingerprints, facial features, voices, 
                  the way someone types, or even how they walk. 
                  Since these features are difficult to replicate, 
                  biometric authentication is seen as a safer alternative to traditional 
                  login methods like passwords (Korolov, 2019).</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>There are two types of biometrics: physical and behavioral. Examples of physical traits include fingerprint 
                   and facial recognition, which are common features in technology today and can be found in smartphones with the 
                   ability to unlock the device. These methods are quick and easy for users and don’t require remembering passwords.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p><u>Examples of common physical biometrics: </u>
                  <p></p>
                  <h3>Fingerprint</h3>
                  <p></p>
                  Fingerprint scanners are one of the most widely used forms of biometric authentication. 
                  Since fingerprints are unique and more efficient to scan, they provide a more convenient way to 
                  confirm an individual's identity, therefore they are found within many smartphones and laptops. 
                  Research finds that 57% of companies use fingerprint authentication in the workplace, 
                  making it the most common biometric method to used today (Korolov, 2019). 
                  <p></p>
                  <h3>Facial &x Eye Recognition</h3>
                  <p></p>
                  Facial recognition utilizes the built-in cameras within devices. 
                  Facial recognition is currently the second most common method of biometric 
                  authentication and is used by 14% of companies (Korolov, 2019).
                  <p></p>
                  <h3>Voice Recognition</h3>
                  <p></p>
                  Voice recognition is often used in digital assistants and telephone-based service portals. 
                  The system analyses the unique sound and pattern of an individual’s voice. 
                  Although this is not as common as other methods, 2% of companies use this method of authentication 
                  for internal security (Korolov, 2019). 
                  <p></p>
                  Behavioral traits are newer and include typing patterns, how an individual moves their mouse, 
                  or how a user interacts with apps. These are often used alongside other methods 
                  to ensure the authentication process is secure.  
                  <p></p>
                  <u>Examples of Behavioral Biometrics include: </u>
                  <p></p>
                  <h3>Typing & Navigation Patterns</h3>
                  <p></p>
                  Every individual has different typing speeds, different pauses between keys, 
                  and unique pressure. Additionally, the way a person controls a mouse, taps on a screen, 
                  or scrolls through a page, is also unique. These small habits can make an individual easily 
                  identifiable. 
                  <p></p>
                  <h3>Physical Movement</h3>
                  <p></p>
                  An example of a person’s physical movement is how they walk. Gait recognition can be useful when 
                  confirming someone’s identity in high-security environments or a second layer of security. 
                  <p></p>
                  <h3>Engagement Patterns</h3>
                  <p></p>
                  This is based off how a person uses their device, including the time of day they are active, 
                  how the device is held, or even how often apps like social media are opened. 
                  These habits can help systems differentiate between a real user and a bot.  
                  <p></p>
                  Overall, biometric authentication is becoming a normal part of daily life as it helps 
                  improve convenience and security. This is especially important as society begins to rely on 
                  digital devices and online services. As technology continues to advance, 
                  we are likely to witness biometrics being utilized in even more areas.</p>
