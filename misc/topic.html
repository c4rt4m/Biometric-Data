<h1>Mitigation of Biometric Data Misuse is the Key to Identity Theft Prevention​</h1>

            <h3>Defining the Topic</h3>
            <div class="paragraph">
                <p>In today’s world, digital security plays an important role in protecting individuals from online threats. One of most serious threats within the area of digital security identity theft, which involves illegally obtaining an individual’s personal details, such as credit card numbers or social security details with the intention of impersonating them for financial or personal gain. (Baecker, 2019). Due to the evolution of technology, biometric data has become more widespread and offers cutting-edge  features that increases protection and security.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>Dantcheva (2015) defined biometrics as “the science of recognizing individuals  based on their physical, behavioral, and physiological  attributes such as fingers, face, iris, gait and voice” (p.1). Unlike passwords and patterns biometric traits cannot be changed, therefore, securing this data is essential in reducing the risk of identity theft.</p>
