      <h2>What is Biometric Data?</h2>
    <div class="paragraph">
      <p>
        Biometric authentication uses unique physical and behavioral characteristics to verify identity.
        It offers greater security than traditional methods such as passwords or PINs.
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <P>Biometric authentication is a method of verifying a person’s identity by using their physical or behavioral traits. 
        These traits are unique to an individual and include forms of identification such as fingerprints, facial features, 
        voices, the way someone types, or even how they walk. Since these features are difficult to replicate, 
        biometric authentication is seen as a safer alternative to traditional login methods like passwords (Korolov, 2019).</P>
      <p></p>
      <p>There are two types of biometrics: physiological and behavioural.
        Examples of physical traits include fingerprint and facial recognition, 
        which are common features in technology today and can be found in smartphones 
        with the ability to unlock the device. Examples of physical traits include fingerprint and facial recognition, 
        which are common features in technology today and can be found in smartphones 
        with the ability to unlock the device. These methods are quick and easy for users and 
        don’t require remembering passwords.  </p>

      <h2>Examples of Physiological Biometrics </h2>
        <div class="paragraph">      
            <h4>Fingerprint</h4>
            <p>Fingerprint scanners are one of the most widely used forms of biometric authentication. 
              Since fingerprints are unique and more efficient to scan, 
              they provide a more convenient way to confirm an individual's identity, 
              therefore they are found within many smartphones and laptops. 
              Research finds that 57% of companies use fingerprint authentication in the workplace, 
              making it the most common biometric method to use today (Korolov, 2019). </p>
            <h4>Facial & Eye Recognition </h4>
            <p>Facial recognition utilizes the built-in cameras within devices. 
              Facial recognition is currently the second most common method of biometric authentication and is 
              used by 14% of companies (Korolov, 2019). </p>
            <h4>Voice Recognition </h4>
            <p>Voice recognition is often used in digital assistants and telephone-based service portals. 
              The system analyses the unique sound and pattern of an individual’s voice. 
              Although this is not as common as other methods, 2% of companies use this method of authentication 
              for internal security (Korolov, 2019). </p>
        </div>
        <h2>Examples of Behavioural Biometrics</h2>
        <div class="paragraph"
            <p>Behavioral traits are newer and include typing patterns, how an individual moves their mouse, 
              or how a user interacts with apps. These are often used alongside other methods to ensure 
              the authentication process is secure.  </p>
            <h4>Typing & Navigation Patters </h4>
            <p>Every individual has different typing speeds, different pauses between keys, and unique pressure. 
              Additionally, the way a person controls a mouse, taps on a screen, or scrolls through a page, is also unique. 
              These small habits can make an individual easily identifiable. </p>
            <h4>Physical Movement </h4>
            <p>An example of a person’s physical movement is how they walk. Gait recognition can be useful when 
              confirming someone’s identity in high-security environments or a second layer of security. </p>
            <h4>Engagement patterns </h4>
            <p>This is based off how a person uses their device, including the time of day they are active, 
              how the device is held, or even how often apps like social media are opened. 
              These habits can help systems differentiate between a real user and a bot.  </p>
            <p>Overall, biometric authentication is becoming a normal part of daily life as it helps improve convenience and 
              security. This is especially important as society begins to rely on digital devices and online services. 
              As technology continues to advance, we are likely to witness biometrics being utilized in even more areas. </P>

  <h2>Benefits of Biometrics</h2>
    <div class="paragraph">
      <p>Implications of Biometric data includes:</p>
        <li>Enhanced Security</li>
        <li>User Convenience</li>
        <li>Fraud Minimization</li>
        <p>As biometric authentication is being adopted globally by the government, airports, and banks, 
          they are becoming a part of everyday living. Biometric authentication has several implications for society, 
          especially when it comes to security and convenience. In banking, biometric authentication is 
          being utilised to fight against fraud and identity theft, using fingerprint and facial ID logins 
          rather than relying on passwords to protect a customer’s account and identity. For example, in Japan, 
          the company “Seven Bank” is trialling a facial recognition ATM system. This biometric system will be 
          used as an extra step in security to authenticate the owner of the car (NEC New Zealand, n.d.). </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Similarly, “airports are one of the largest adopters of biometric security systems” 
          (NEC New Zealand, n.d.) as they use biometrics to identify passengers at airport security. 
          For instance, passengers can choose between face recognition technology to check in at self-service counters, 
          making the process more efficient.  </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Biometric data is being used within law enforcement agencies such as the FBI who rely on the biometric system for 
          criminal investigations and identification. As a result of biometric data, it reduces fraud and identity theft, 
          enhances safety and security, and provides better convenience for society. The article, Wired, states that “U.S 
          law enforcement agencies have the facial recognition data of 117 million Americans” (NEC New Zealand, n.d.). </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Further examples of biometrics can also be seen in devices and apps, 
          where biometrics act as an extra layer of security, making everyday tasks quicker and easier. </p>
      </div>

<h2>Risks & Limitations</h2>
    <div class="paragraph">
        <li>Biometric breaches are permanent — you can’t change your fingerprint.</li>
        <li>Storing biometric data raises serious privacy concerns.</li>
        <li>Advanced spoofing techniques may still bypass biometric systems.</li>
        <p></p>
        <p>One main reason biometric data has significant implications for society is because it creates a permanent 
          link between an individual’s physical and behavioural characteristics and their digital identity. 
          Human traits are unchangeable, and unlike other forms of identification such as passwords and ID’s; 
          it cannot be reset. Once an individual’s information has been collected, that data becomes a permanent 
          digital record. Although biometric authentication can be more secure, efficient, and convenient, 
          it also opens more possibilities for privacy risks and cultural and social implications. 
          NRC (2019) explains that biometric systems require people to physically engage with technology; 
          however, not everyone is comfortable with that, especially when it involves personal and cultural beliefs. </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>For instance, a social implication is that, out of fear of hygiene or disease, a person may refuse to 
          use a fingerprint scanner, or due to religious beliefs about photographs, an individual may object to facial 
          recognition. The system must take into consideration how a variety of people might react about the use of 
          biometric systems, whether they are inclusive to all religions and cultures (NRC, 2010). </p>
